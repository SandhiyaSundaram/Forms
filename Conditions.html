	<h1>Terms and Condition Form</h1>
	<h2>Terms and Condition</h2>
	<p>Please read and submit below...</p>
	<h3>IDENTIFICATION:</h3>
	 <p>Guests are required to make reservations in the full name that is listed on his/her government document they will use for travel. If you need to make any changes to a name after travel documents have been issued, clients will be responsible for all name change fees, if applicable.</p>

    <h3>PAYMENTS:</h3> 
    <p>Our merchant account is with Square. This will allow our clients to make payments using major credit cards.  No other form of payment is accepted at this time.</p>

    <h3>REFUNDS:</h3>
    <p>All payments to Passion Getaways are non-refundable and non-transferable. This is because Passion Getaways has contractual agreements with hotels, airlines and other vendors that will not allow us to obtain any refunds. This way we can keep our package prices competitive and allow you to make monthly payments on your vacation.</p>

    <h3>PASSPORTS AND VISAS:</h3>
    <p>Passengers are responsible for ensuring that they have the proper travel documents and MUST CHECK with the respective consulate(s) or a visa agency to determine whether any visas or passports are required. Passports are required to be valid for at least 6 months after the date of travel. Some countries require a full blank “VISA” page in the passport for stamping purposes. Any information provided on travel description pertains to US citizens only. Non-US citizens should check with the respective consulate of the country(s) to be visited for current entry requirements. We strongly suggest all cruise passengers to have a valid passport in their possession while cruising.</p>

    <h3>TRAVEL PROTECTION:</h3>
    <p>Missing a vacation is bad enough. Losing the money you paid for your vacation is even worse. Therefore, we highly recommend Travel Protection that helps provide coverage for Trip Cancellation, Interruption, Baggage Loss or Delay, Medical Expenses and more. You are required to select and purchase travel insurance yourself for domestic and international tours. For Caribbean, Mexico and Cruise Tours, we can add travel insurance to your package when making your reservations.</p>

    <h3>TRAVEL DOCUMENTS:</h3>
    <p>Provided full payment is received no later than your Final Payment Due date, travel documents and travel instructions will be sent via email and/or mail 30 days or earlier prior to travel. If paper documents are requested when e-documents are available, documents will be delivered via USPS approximately 14-21 days prior, and a fee of $30 will apply. A complete street address is required (no PO boxes).</p> 

    <h3>CHILDREN:</h3>
    <P>All children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. The minimum age for children on most tours is 6 months. The minimum age for South Africa and Dubai Tours is 12. The minimum age for European Tour programs is 12. The minimum age for cruise tours is 6 months old and child must sail in a cabin with an adult over the age of 25 years of age. Discounts for children sharing a room as the third person may apply to children under 12 at some resorts on Caribbean and Mexico Tours. Accompanying adults are responsible for the safety of their children including providing any necessary safety equipment (such as infant/child seats) where appropriate. Please note that many countries have adopted practices to prevent international abductions of children. If a person under the age of 18 years will be traveling with an adult other than his/her parents, or with only one parent, a notarized letter written by the parents, or non-traveling parent, granting authorization to travel, including the dates of travel should be carried.</P>

    <h3>PRICES:</h3> 
    <p>ll prices listed are per person based upon shared twin room occupancy unless otherwise clearly specified. Prices do not include items of a personal nature such as laundry, wines, water, beverages, food (other than at all-inclusive resorts or where clearly specified), passport and visa fees, insurance, and foreign port taxes unless specifically indicated in the package inclusions. Prices are correct at time of publication; however, as airfares continually fluctuate and classes of service may have limited capacity, tour package prices and availability will change accordingly. In case of human or computer error, Passion Getaways reserves the right to re-invoice for the correct price or service. A full refund will be made to passengers who choose not to pay an increase, provided Passion Getaways receives a written cancellation within five days of the price increase notification.</p>

<h3>HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS:</h3>
<p>All rooms requested are standard twin-bedded (two single beds) rooms with private facilities unless you have specifically requested a king/double size bed. Please understand although we will make a bed type request on your behalf, bed types are subject to availability. Room selection in all cases is strictly at the discretion of the hotel's management on a run-of-house basis. Triple and quad occupancy rooms consist of two beds for cruises, where triple and quad rooms will consist of a twin bed for each person. Some single rooms are smaller than a standard room size. The number of persons accommodated does not dictate the room size. Although available at most 4 and 5-star hotels, use of air-conditioning abroad differs greatly from the United States. Many European hotels were built before central air-conditioning was introduced. Air-conditioning is often shut down at night and from the end until the start of the summer months. All hotel rates are based on Passion Getaways' agreements with its suppliers and are not negotiable. Hotel check-in time is generally not before 3:00 p.m. and check-out time are prior to noon. Please be sure that adequate arrangements for accommodations have been taken into consideration when a late-night flight is being used. If a day room is included in the itinerary, check-out will normally be 6:00 p.m. We reserve the right to make substitutions with hotels of equal standard. There will be no refunds for any difference in the cost of those accommodations.</p>

<h3>MEALS:</h3>
<p>As specified in each itinerary. Meals are based on the hotel's or restaurant's buffet or set menu. In general, beverages are not included, unless specifically stated. Although Passion Getaways cannot make guarantees, every effort will be made to honor special dietary requests submitted in writing at least 4 weeks prior to departure at <a href=""> booking@passiongetawaysllc.com</a></p>

<h3>CRUISES:</h3>
<p>Ship & Itinerary Changes: Cruise itineraries and ships are subject to change without notice. Furthermore, cruise ships may be chartered and/or departure dates canceled, in which case all monies will be refunded.

<h3>MEDICAL SERVICES:</h3>
